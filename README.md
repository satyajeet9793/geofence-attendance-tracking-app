Geofence-Employe-Attendance-Tracking-Application
Excited to share my latest project: Onsite Attendance Tracking App â€“ a modern, mobile-first solution designed to simplify and secure employee attendance using geofencing and real-time location tracking.

The challenge and our solution
Managing attendance across multiple locations is difficult. Traditional methods often lead to errors, buddy punching, and lack of transparency. This app solves these problems by using geofencing to ensure attendance is accurate, reliable, and tamper-proof. It helps both employees and admins track and manage attendance with confidence.

Key features
Secure authentication and role management: Role-based access for Admin and Employee with smooth, context-aware login.

Geofenced attendance: Employees can only check in or out when they are physically present within the assigned location. Real-time GPS validation removes the chances of time theft.

Interactive admin dashboard: Real-time map shows live employee locations with custom markers, attendance status, and geofence controls.

Modern UI/UX design: Clean, responsive interface that works in both light and dark mode. Navigation is simple and user-friendly.

Smart notifications and feedback: In-app alerts for check-ins, errors, and admin actions using snackbars and messages.

Technical overview
The app is built using React Native with TypeScript for cross-platform mobile development. UI components use React Native Paper for a consistent look. It is deployed via Expo and uses Google Maps API for live maps. Context API handles app-wide state and AsyncStorage stores data locally on the device.

There is complete error handling for permission issues, network failures, and edge cases. Employees can manually check out or have their status updated based on their location.

Real-world impact
This app improves workforce management in real time. It increases transparency with location tracking, ensures accuracy through geofencing, and automates attendance for better efficiency. It is ideal for companies with teams at multiple locations looking to upgrade from manual to digital attendance systems.

If you're facing challenges with attendance in your organization, this might be the solution you're looking for.
